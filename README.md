## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I ended up using CSS Grid for the layout of the mobile and desktop design. I couldn't get the social-media toggle section to line up with the share button on mobile and as a result, I increased the padding on the section resulting in a thicker-looking box. I did not know how to create the tear-drop looking caption box but found a solution through stackoverflow! (TY).
